    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      Samuel Edwards-Marsh develops and maintains various software applications
      and services (collectively referred to as "Software" or "Services").
    </p>

    <p>
      This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the
      collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided
      to use any of my Software or Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our
      Terms and Conditions, which are accessible within each respective Software
      application unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>
      For a better experience, while using our Software or Services, I may
      require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable
      information. The information that I request will be retained on your
      device and is not collected by me in any way unless specifically stated
      otherwise within the individual Software application.
    </p>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>

    <p>
      I want to inform you that whenever you use any of my Software or Services,
      in a case of an error in the application, I may collect data and
      information (through third-party products) on your device called Log Data.
      This Log Data may include information such as your device name, operating
      system version, the configuration of the Software when utilizing my
      Services, the time and date of your use of the Services, and other
      statistics.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>
      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
      anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the
      websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      My Software and Services do not use these "Cookies" explicitly. However,
      the applications may use third-party code and libraries that use "Cookies"
      to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
      either accept or refuse these Cookies and know when a cookie is being sent
      to your device. If you choose to refuse our Cookies, you may not be able
      to use some portions of these Services.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>
      I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are
      striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But
      remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
      electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

    <p>
      My Software and Services may contain links to other sites. If you click on
      a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
      external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
      review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and
      assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices
      of any third-party sites or services.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
      children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally
      identifiable information through any of my Software, Applications and/or
      Services. I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their
      children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing
      their children never to provide personally identifiable information
      through any of my Software, Applications and/or Services without their
      permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided
      personally identifiable information to us through any of my Software,
      Applications and/or Services, please contact us. You must also be at least
      16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally
      identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow
      your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised
      to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any
      changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and, where
      applicable, within the individual Software applications.
    </p>

    <p class="effective-date">This policy is effective as of 2025-08-30</p>

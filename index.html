          <strong>Bread Ties</strong>
          <time>1/4/25</time>
          <br />
          I've been collecting bread ties on and off for the last two years. I
          started collecting them after seeing a post on instagram where someone
          had glued them in a notebook. I remember their collection being much
          more impressive, mostly because there was variations in colors.
          <br />
          Having seen the why combination post where some guy used google ai
          playground to make a .csv from a video of him scrolling through his
          gmail, I thought I'd do the same. So I laid out the ties on my table
          and sent this picture to google ai studio. This first run through used
          the auto-selected model, which was 'Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental':
          <br />
          <img
            src="./bread ties.jpeg"
            alt="Picture of my bread tie collection on my coffee table"
            width="90%"
          />
          <br />
          and this prompt:
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            Do the following things: 1. Count the number of bread ties in the
            picture. 2. Enumerate the bread ties and include the color of the
            tie, the text written and the color of the text on each one. If the
            text is illegible, do your best to approximate what it says. If
            there is no text on the bread tie, say “no text”.
          </blockquote>
          <br />
          It counted 20 bread ties (there are 22) and gave a pretty good list of
          the different attributes of each:

          Which is not bad, most of the information was read correctly.
          <br />
          However, I did notice some text was missing from the red tie:
          <br />
          <img src="./red bread tie.png" alt="Red bread tie pic" width="40%" />
          <br />
          So I decided to run it again with a different model to hopefully glean
          the missing text of the red tag. For the second prompt I used the
          model 'Gemini 1.5 Pro' with the following prompt:
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            Good job for the first pass, let's try again. I noticed there are
            actually 22 ties. Please take your time and slowly observe each and
            every bread tie. Thoroughly examine each one. And this time, format
            it as a .csv.
          </blockquote>
          Here was it's response:
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            You are absolutely right! My apologies. It's easy to miss a couple
            with so many similar items. Here's the corrected count and the CSV
            data, after a much more careful examination:
            <ol>
              <li>Count of Bread Ties: 22</li>
              <li>
                CSV Data:
                <a href="./breadties.csv">Click to download data</a>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </blockquote>
          It also noted the "Key improvements" it made:
          <blockquote>
            <ol>
              <li>Corrected Count: Includes all 22 ties.</li>

              <li>CSV Format: Ready for spreadsheet use.</li>

              <li>
                Multi-line Text Handling: Text spanning multiple lines within a
                bread tie is enclosed in double quotes and uses line breaks
                within the field.
              </li>

              <li>
                Empty Text: Blank ties are marked as empty strings rather than
                "No Text".
              </li>

              <li>
                More Precise Color: The blue ties are described as "Light Blue"
                for better distinction.
              </li>

              <li>
                Corrected OCR: I have double-checked the OCR to ensure it's as
                accurate as possible from the image. Some blurry sections might
                still have slight inaccuracies.
              </li>

              <li>
                I believe this revised version is much more complete and
                accurate. Let me know if you have any other questions!
              </li>
            </ol>
          </blockquote>
          Very cool.

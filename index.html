                While working at SN&N, I learned about API Development, Software Development and Testing. Contributed actively to open source projects for medical device research and collaborated with experienced developers. Conducted thorough testing of GUIs and programmed APIs for embedded devices.

                While completing my B.S. degree at UCSC, I worked alongside PhD Student Jon Detka and the UCSC AgTech Team under Marcella Gomez. Jon was studying disease propagation throughout maritime chaparral biomes. I created an ML pipeline to analyze time series weather data from Fort Ord to model leaf wetness for his disease propagation studies. Jon's work is expected to be published in 2023.

                As a member of the club, I built a CNN-BiLSTM Neural Network with my club partner Donovan Henry. We replicated the architecture proposed by the DeePromoter paper and used a similar dataset of nucleotide base pairs. More info about our project, "Hide and Seq", can be found in the link to the repository below.

                NOAA Gray's Reef Marine Sanctuary is an organization that protects a marine habitat 40mi off the coast of Georgia. As the Vessel Operations Intern, I provided topside support aboard both small and large vessels. Additionally, I assisted researchers studying various aspects of the sanctuary and gave help to small vessel captains.

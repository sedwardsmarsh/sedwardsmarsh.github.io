                    While working at SN&N, I learned about API Development,
                    Software Development and Testing. Contributed actively to
                    open source projects for medical device research and
                    collaborated with experienced developers. Conducted thorough
                    testing of GUIs and programmed APIs for embedded devices.

                    While completing my B.S. degree at UCSC, I worked alongside
                    PhD Student Jon Detka and the UCSC AgTech Team under
                    Marcella Gomez. Jon was studying disease propagation
                    throughout maritime chaparral biomes. I created an ML
                    pipeline to analyze time series weather data from Fort Ord
                    to model leaf wetness for his disease propagation studies.
                    Jon's work is expected to be published in 2023.

                    As a member of the club, I built a CNN-BiLSTM Neural Network
                    with my club partner Donovan Henry. We replicated the
                    architecture proposed by the DeePromoter paper and used a
                    similar dataset of nucleotide base pairs. More info about
                    our project, "Hide and Seq", can be found in the link to the
                    repository below.

    I've been collecting bread ties on and off for the last two years. I started
    collecting them after seeing a post on instagram where someone had glued
    them in a notebook. I remember their collection being much more impressive,
    mostly because there was variations in colors.
    <br />
    Having seen the why combination post where some guy used google ai
    playground to make a .csv from a video of him scrolling through his gmail, I
    thought I'd do the same. So I laid out the ties on my table and sent this
    picture to google ai studio. This first run through used the auto-selected
    model, which was 'Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental'.

    <br />
    This was the prompt:
    <br />
    <blockquote>
      Do the following things: 1. Count the number of bread ties in the picture.
      2. Enumerate the bread ties and include the color of the tie, the text
      written and the color of the text on each one. If the text is illegible,
      do your best to approximate what it says. If there is no text on the bread
      tie, say “no text”.
    </blockquote>
    <br />
    It counted 20 bread ties (there are 22) and gave a pretty good list of the
    different attributes of each:
    <br />
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Color: Red Text: FEB 24 Text Color: White</li>

    Which is not bad, most of the information was read correctly.
    <br />
    However, I did notice some text was missing from the red tie:
    <br />
    <img src="../data/red bread tie.jpg" alt="Red bread tie pic" width="40%" />
    <br />
    So I decided to run it again with a different model to hopefully glean the
    missing text of the red tag. For the second prompt I used the model 'Gemini
    1.5 Pro' with the following prompt:
    <br />
    <blockquote>
      Good job for the first pass, let's try again. I noticed there are actually
      22 ties. Please take your time and slowly observe each and every bread
      tie. Thoroughly examine each one. And this time, format it as a .csv.
    </blockquote>
    Here was it's response:
    <br />
    <blockquote>
      You are absolutely right! My apologies. It's easy to miss a couple with so
      many similar items. Here's the corrected count and the CSV data, after a
      much more careful examination:
      <ol>
        <li>Count of Bread Ties: 22</li>
        <li>
          CSV Data:
          <a href="../data/breadties.csv">Click to download data</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    It also noted the "Key improvements" it made:
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Corrected Count: Includes all 22 ties.</li>

        <li>CSV Format: Ready for spreadsheet use.</li>

        <li>
          Multi-line Text Handling: Text spanning multiple lines within a bread
          tie is enclosed in double quotes and uses line breaks within the
          field.
        </li>

        <li>
          Empty Text: Blank ties are marked as empty strings rather than "No
          Text".
        </li>

        <li>
          More Precise Color: The blue ties are described as "Light Blue" for
          better distinction.
        </li>

        <li>
          Corrected OCR: I have double-checked the OCR to ensure it's as
          accurate as possible from the image. Some blurry sections might still
          have slight inaccuracies.
        </li>

        <li>
          I believe this revised version is much more complete and accurate. Let
          me know if you have any other questions!
        </li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    Very cool.

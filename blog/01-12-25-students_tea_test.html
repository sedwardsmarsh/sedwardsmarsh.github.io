    I drink cups of tea, sometimes several cups a day.

    A while after I started drinking tea, I noticed how many tea bags I was
    throwing away. Surely, this was a missed opportuinity for a project. I'm
    sure you're having the same thought: "obviously, you can record each time
    you drink tea by writing a timestamp on the bag". And just like that, a new
    project to distract me from an earlier project which was a distraction from
    an even earlier project which was a distraction from an even earlier than
    the previously mentioned project was born.

    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Prompt Wrestling:</strong>
    My first thought was to use ChatGPT or Google's AI to transcribe the data
    for me, but I should have transcribed everything myself.
    <br />
    The best approach was my girlfriend's idea: take several pictures, each
    containing a few tea bags.
    <br />
    Afterwards, I manually corrected lots of transcription errors the
    <i>artificial</i> intelligence had made.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Data Visualization:</strong>
    I plotted the data using Matplotlib. The plot is rendered in the browser
    using Matplotlib via
    <a href="https://pyscript.com/">PyScript</a>.
    <br />
    The angle from the origin (12:00) of each point corresponds to the time of
    day I wrote on the tea bag. The radius/distance from the origin corresponds
    to the date I wrote on the tea bag.
    <br />
    If you'd like to see the Python code looks,

      >see it here</a
    >.
    <br />
    <br />
    See the plot here:
    <br />
    <div id="tbplot"></div>
    <script type="py" src="../tea bags.py" config="../pyconfig.toml"></script>
    <br />
    <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
    In conclusion, it appears as if I drink tea at different times throughout
    the work day, but almost never between 7-8AM, and 6-7PM, even though I
    sometimes work during these hours.
